# Project Retrospective

Letâ€™s take a few minutes as a class and capture as many insights possible in the categories below.  One of the instructional team will go through each category and capture as many thoughts as possible.  Feel free to come off mute and speak your thoughts out loud. 

## Lessons Learned

I learned about seperating a full stack application into components. In doing this it helped give me a clear picture of how the backend logic should look like.

## Problem Areas

Some large problem areas were definitely getting used to async/await. Promises were always giving me errors and i couldn't understand why. I definitely need to read up on them.

## Future Directions

Create a proper form where users can register or login. I think this would definitely help make my app feel more professional.

## Accomplishments

I am extremely proud of what i've accomplished after this hectic week. Before coming to GA i had no idea what an API was. Now i can say that i've built one as well as having a better understanding of what they are.
